# Scripts

A collections of my scripts that i have made. Made avalable to you if you have any use for them.

## Globalharpoon

Like [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) but for your whole system. The most useful
script here by far that lets you quickly add and remove files from a list that you can quickly
switch to. Just configure it with a global hotkey daemon of choice (or through your desktop) and 
start moving around your system. 

By default it launches 
```bash
$TERMINAL -e $EDITIOR
```
but this can be changed.


## Oggart

Attack an image to an ogg file through metadata

## Qrclip

Take what is in your clip board and make a qrcode out of it
